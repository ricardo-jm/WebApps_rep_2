Online Store php project created for Web Applications class(TU-054 Computer Systems TUDublin Course)
Author: Ricardo Martins, Student B00149259


 - User needs to login to be able to see web pages other than the login and register pages.
 - Admin user can add/delete and update products while other users are only able to view the products list and add them to the shopping cart.


- The Shopping cart was created using the tutorial Robert provided us mixed with the one found in  https://phppot.com/php/simple-php-shopping-cart/.
Features of both shopping cart tutorials were used and mixed.

- The functions have the variable $connection passed to avoid the error "Uncaught Error: Call to a member function prepare() on null"
The solution for this error was found in  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44957405/php-pdo-uncaught-error-call-to-a-member-function-prepare-on-null
